This directory contains the source code for my Master's Thesis. It is written in
LaTeX, and can be compiled e.g. using `pdflatex` with command:

       $ pdflatex main.tex

Sections are written in individual files and placed in the `sections`
directory. The file `setup.tex` contains packages, styling, configurations and
commands. The front page style (KUstyle.sty) is inspired by Chlo√© Rouyer's PhD
Thesis template published on Overleaf*. See `main.tex` for more details.
