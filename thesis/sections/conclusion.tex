\paragraph{Future work}
This thesis leaves future work regarding the division implementation. First and
foremost, the parallel implementation should be validated. In relation to that,
it should be considered whether the increased number of guard digits is a true
revision to the algorithm, or due to an error in the sequential prototype. After
it validates, the remaining inefficient subroutines should be reworked, mainly
ensuring proper growth of the multiplication input lengths over refinement
iterations. The last step is to evaluate its performance by benchmarking over
big integer sizes, divisor precision, and the underlying multiplication methods,
such as FFT and classical.
