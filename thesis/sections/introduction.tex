% Lastly, the files \texttt{div.c} and \texttt{div.fut} contains implementations
% of exact big integer division by whole shifted inverse. The C implementation is
% a sequential adaptation of the algorithm proposed by Watt in
% \cite{watt2023efficient}, wherefrom we parallelize in the Futhark
% implementation. These are not performance-optimized in the same manner as
% addition and multiplication, but moreso serves as a proof of concept of a
% parallel implementation of the algorithm. During the development we found some
% valuable insight, notably a corner case unconsidered in the original formulation
% of the algorithm. Hence, we also present a revised algorithm specialized for big
% integers and parallel execution.
