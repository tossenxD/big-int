My Master's Thesis source code repository.

This Thesis is all about arithmetics of big integers in parallel on
GPGPU. Following is the abstract from the Thesis report:

       <INSERT ABSTRACT>

This repository is structured in four directories; `cuda` and `futhark` contains
the bulk of the product of the Thesis, i.e., all the parallel code and
implementations in the respective language. `prototypes` contains sequential
prototypes written in C, which have served the purpose to familiarize algorithms
before converting them to a parallel version. 'thesis' contains the source code
of the Thesis report.

The four directories contains their own README's, detailing what they contain
and how to run them. The code is generally well-commented, and should speak for
itself, but the report displays a more in-depth look of the designs of the
algorithms - both their sequential intuitions and parallel augmentations.

The Thesis was written over a period of four months from 31th of January 2024 to
31th of May 2024.
